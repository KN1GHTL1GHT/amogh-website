      Hello! I'm Amogh, a software engineer based in Portland, Oregon. I specialize in building full-stack applications
      with a strong focus on mobile development and cloud integration. My approach to software engineering combines
      technical precision with user-centered design, always striving to create solutions that are both powerful and
      intuitive. I'm particularly skilled at integrating complex systems—from Google Cloud APIs to machine learning
      frameworks—while maintaining clean, maintainable code.

      When I'm not coding, you'll find me cheering on my favorite sports teams (Trailblazers and Seahawks), exploring Portland's incredible food
      scene, or spending time with my dog. I believe the best software comes from developers who maintain balance and
      curiosity in all aspects of life. My strengths lie in rapid prototyping, problem-solving under constraints, and
      bridging the gap between technical capabilities and user needs. Whether it's Android development in Kotlin,
      building scalable web applications, or integrating AI/ML features, I thrive on turning complex challenges into
      elegant solutions. Check out my portfolio and devlogs to see what I've been building!
